## How This App Works?
This app consists of one single page (except login and register) and you can manage all your works there. On the left side, you can fill all the informations about your CV and you can preview the changes in real time on the right side.

## Things I Worked With While Developing Resume Builder
- Django
- Real Time Fetch Requests with Javascript
- Managing Data with Requests
- Amazon S3 as File Storage
- Updating Data in Real Time in Preview Section
- User Authentication and Management
